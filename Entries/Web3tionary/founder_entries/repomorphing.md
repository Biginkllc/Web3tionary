REPOMORPHING

Founder Entry

Pronunciation: /ˈrē-pō-môr-fiŋ/
Part of Speech: noun · verb

Definition

Repomorphing is the act of allowing an idea, once seeded in a public repository, to evolve through reinterpretation, re-expression, and restructuring by many—without erasing its origin, ownership, or proof-of-work. The form changes; the provenance remains.

Plain Meaning

Changing how an idea is expressed, not who first expressed it.

Core Intent

Repomorphing exists to enable ideas to travel safely through time, cultures, skill levels, and risk environments—without requiring coordination, permission, or central authority.

It is not designed to persuade.
It is designed to propagate interpretation.

Foundational Characteristics

Provenance-Preserving — origin remains referenceable

Fork-Friendly — parallel meanings are expected

Non-Directive — no call to action is implied

Non-Hierarchical — no version outranks another

Culturally Adaptive — language shifts without erasure

What Repomorphing Is Not

Not command-and-control

Not consensus building

Not authorship dilution

Not anonymity by default

Not governance

Practical Expression

Repomorphing may occur through:

rewritten READMEs

forks and mirrors

visual or metaphorical reinterpretations

IPFS-published artifacts (CIDs)

independent domain expressions

Each repomorph stands alone.
None invalidate the others.

Ethical Boundary

No single participant can claim responsibility for what emerges beyond their own interpretation.
Meaning is shared; intent is distributed.

Why It Exists

In open systems, suppression targets coordination.
Repomorphing removes coordination as a requirement.

Closing Note

This Founder Entry establishes semantic gravity, not authority.
It is a starting coordinate—meant to be repomorphed.
