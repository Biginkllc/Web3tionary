## 1. Plain Definition
Blockyright is a Web3-native method of establishing idea ownership by placing a timestamped, immutable record of the idea in public spaces — such as GitHub commits, IPFS CIDs, or decentralized domain metadata — instead of relying on traditional copyright systems.

It is the open-source, timestamp-first form of protecting creativity.

---

## 2. Technical Definition
Blockyright is a decentralized provenance mechanism that uses a combination of:

- Git commit history  
- IPFS content identifiers (CIDs)  
- Blockchain timestamps  
- Domain-based publication (UNS/ENS)  

to create a verifiable, censorship-resistant, publicly accessible proof-of-origin for creative or conceptual work.

It democratizes “first claim” rights by shifting protection from institutional filing to public cryptographic evidence.

## 3. Parable / Use Case
Instead of paying for legal filings, she uploaded her drawings to GitHub, pinned the concept note to IPFS, and linked the CID to a domain she owned.

Before she even went to sleep, the idea was **blockyrighted** — permanently etched into public, timestamped records for anyone to confirm.

---

## 4. Example Sentences
- “Let’s blockyright this idea before sharing it publicly.”  
- “The repo proves who blockyrighted it first.”  
- “Artists without lawyers now use blockyright methods to protect their work.”

---

## 5. Cultural Notes
Blockyright emerged as a response to the limitations, costs, and inequities of traditional copyright systems, especially among marginalized or under-resourced creators.

It blends open-source culture, cryptographic transparency, and ethical accountability.  
Those who attempt to claim blockyrighted ideas as their own risk significant reputational damage.
