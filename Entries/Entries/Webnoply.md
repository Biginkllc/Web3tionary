## 1. Plain Definition
**Webnoply** is a Web3-based economic strategy game that uses decentralized assets — such as domains, NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and DAOs — to simulate real-world financial decision-making in a virtual or tabletop environment.

In simple terms:  
**A Web3 twist on Monopoly, where every square reflects real decentralized economics.**

---

## 2. Technical Definition
Webnoply is a hybrid of:

- **game theory**  
- **micro-economics**  
- **blockchain incentives**  
- **digital property ownership**  
- **crypto asset management**  
- **on-chain behavior modeling**  
- **domain strategy**  

Unlike traditional Monopoly, Webnoply integrates:

### **Decentralized Components**
- NFT deeds  
- tokenized rent  
- DAO-governed rule changes  
- airdrop rewards  
- passthruwallet mechanics  
- mintpass tokens  
- protocol tax blocks  
- blockchain-based player actions  

### **Economic Components**
- supply/demand cycles  
- liquidity flow  
- staking opportunities  
- asset appreciation  
- market downturn scenarios  
- incentive rewards  
- player-controlled inflation or deflation  

### **Domain & Identity Components**
- Web3 domain properties (e.g., `.crypto`, `.nft`, `.blockchain`)  
- message boards (Web3msgboard)  
- IPFS vault storage  
- reputation scores based on player fairness or greed  

Webnoply can exist as:

- a tabletop board game  
- a digital simulation  
- a DAO-controlled multiplayer experience  
- a learning tool for crypto newcomers  
- a strategy training environment for decentralized governance  

It is both **educational** and **predictive** of real-world crypto behavior.

## 3. Parable / Use Case
A community wanted to teach teenagers how to understand crypto safely — without loss, speculation, or confusion.

So they printed the Webnoply board, complete with mint passes, airdrop squares, DAO vote cards, and passthruwallet routes.

Within two hours of gameplay, the teens were discussing:

> “price floors,”  
> “DAO votes,”  
> “how airdrops change markets,”  
> and  
> “which Web3 domains gave you the best position.”

The game taught them what textbooks couldn’t.

That’s the power of **Webnoply.**

## 4. Example Sentences
- “We’re testing a DAO version of Webnoply where rule changes are voted on live.”  
- “He learned crypto safely through Webnoply before touching a real wallet.”  
- “Webnoply properties include domains like `.crypto`, `.nft`, and `.blockchain`.”  
- “The passthruwallet square sends all players’ funds through a public router.”

---

## 5. Cultural Notes
Webnoply is part education, part social experiment.

It highlights:

- how decentralized economies operate  
- how greed or collaboration affects value  
- how governance works in DAOs  
- how innovation can disrupt legacy systems  
- how domains behave as digital properties  
- how DAO votes can improve (or break) a system  

Your early **8/21/25 Webnoply game-board image** is the first known visual reference for the concept — making it an important **provenance artifact**.

This image documents:

- early square layout  
- economic categories  
- block types  
- color-coding  
- domain integration  
- airdrop rows  
- passthruwallet routes  
- Web3 cultural signals  

It will later become part of Webnoply’s “Origin Folder.”
