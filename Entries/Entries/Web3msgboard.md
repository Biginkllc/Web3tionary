> **Root Term:** Web3msgboard  
> **Expanded Form:** Web3 Message Board  
> **Category:** A – Functional / Communication Tools  
> **Entry Type:** Founder Entry

## 1. Plain Definition
A **Web3msgboard** is a decentralized message board created by using the public profile or bio section of a Web3 domain — allowing individuals to post updates, contact details, notices, or communications that anyone can read without needing a centralized platform.

In simple terms:  
**Your Web3 domain becomes your bulletin board.**

---

## 2. Technical Definition
A Web3msgboard is a communication method where:

- the **UD profile bio**,  
- a decentralized domain metadata field, or  
- linked GitHub/IPFS pages  

…serve as the user’s message board or posting space.

This enables:

- persistent public messages  
- off-platform communication  
- identity-linked announcements  
- message visibility without login  
- censorship-resistant posting  
- a simple, low-cost messaging protocol  

A Web3msgboard can be as basic as text or as advanced as:

- IPFS-linked notices  
- JSON message lists  
- DAO member announcements  
- marketplace postings  
- drop schedules  
- service availability  
- “send me a message by writing to your own bio” exchanges  

It is one of the earliest **peer-to-peer communication systems** available directly through decentralized identity infrastructure.

## 3. Parable / Use Case
Two people met online through a crypto discussion but lost contact when one platform shut down.

Instead of chasing usernames across social media, one said:

> “Check my Web3msgboard.”

He updated the bio of his UD domain with a meeting time and link.  
Within minutes, the message was visible to the other person —  
no account, no inbox, no app required.

That became their ongoing communication channel.

## 4. Example Sentences
- “Leave me a note on your Web3msgboard and I’ll respond.”  
- “The DAO posts weekly updates on the founder’s Web3msgboard.”  
- “Your UD bio can double as a Web3msgboard for collaborators.”  
- “Recruiters are beginning to scan Web3msgboards for talent signals.”

## 5. Cultural Notes
Web3msgboards represent a shift from:

- platform-owned communication → **identity-owned communication**  
- inbox-based messaging → **public bulletin messaging**  
- centralized profiles → **decentralized presence**  

They are especially useful when:

- platforms censor or shut down accounts  
- people need a stable identity across networks  
- international communication barriers exist  
- users want fully public notifications  
- the message does not require conversation, only visibility  

This term captures a critical piece of early decentralized culture —  
the moment when **a domain became more than a name:  
it became a place to communicate.**
