## 1. Plain Definition
Barterable Crypto refers to any cryptocurrency that a person is willing to trade directly for goods, services, labor, or another form of value — without using an exchange or fiat conversion.

If someone asks,  
**“What’s your barterable crypto of choice?”**  
they are asking which coin you prefer for person-to-person trade.

## 2. Technical Definition
Barterable Crypto represents the set of digital assets that an individual or entity designates as acceptable for:

- peer-to-peer swaps  
- real-world trade  
- service exchanges  
- micro-payments  
- private transactions  
- community economy participation  

It is a foundational concept for:

- decentralized commerce  
- post-fiat local trade systems  
- disaster-resilient economies  
- informal markets  
- cross-border direct value exchange  

Barterable Crypto does not require:

- price stability

- institutional permission  
- an exchange account  

It is defined solely by **mutual agreement and blockchain confirmation.**

## 5. Cultural Notes
Barterable Crypto emerges most strongly during:

- inflation  
- recession  
- supply chain disruption  
- distrust in banks  
- political uncertainty  
- global currency devaluation
