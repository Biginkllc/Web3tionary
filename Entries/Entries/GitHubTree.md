## 1. Plain Definition
A **GitHubTree** is the structured map of a creator’s GitHub repositories — showing how ideas, projects, entries, and documents branch from one another over time.

In simple terms:  
**Your GitHubTree is your digital family tree of ideas.**

---

## 2. Technical / Contextual Definition
A GitHubTree represents the *ecosystem-level structure* of a creator’s or organization’s work.  

It includes:

- core repositories  
- sub-projects  
- forks  
- prototypes  
- documentation vaults  
- experimental branches  
- supporting files  
- provenance links  
- cross-repo relationships  

Unlike a simple repo list, the GitHubTree expresses:

### **Hierarchy**
- primary → secondary repos  
- conceptual ancestors → descendants  

### **Relationships**
- how one idea evolved into another  
- which repos support which projects  
- where entries originated and where they moved  

### **Provenance**
- timestamps  
- version trails  
- branching paths  
- archive markers  

### **Identity**
The GitHubTree becomes a creator’s *public résumé*,  
*innovation history*,  
and *idea graph*.

This term is crucial for open-source ecosystems where clarity, lineage, and transparency matter.

## 3. Parable / Use Case
A new contributor wanted to understand how the Random Rain Project connected to Web3tionary and Blockyright.

Instead of explaining everything verbally, Lloyd said:

> “Check my GitHubTree.”

By viewing the interconnected repos — each a branch leading to another —  
the contributor instantly saw:

- what came first  
- how concepts evolved  
- which repos anchored others  
- where new terms belonged  
- how the ecosystem grew over years  

The GitHubTree was a *visual biography of innovation*.

---

## 4. Example Sentences
- “Review my GitHubTree to understand the sequence of the projects.”  
- “His GitHubTree shows the evolution from one idea to an entire ecosystem.”  
- “The DAO requires a GitHubTree for major contributors to maintain transparency.”  
- “Your GitHubTree is starting to show branches you didn’t even know you planted.”

## 5. Cultural Notes
The GitHubTree removes the need for:

- secrecy  
- lost notes  
- hidden drafts  
- siloed progress  

It reinforces:

- open-source culture  
- intellectual honesty  
- version-based storytelling  
- provenance tracking  
- decentralized collaboration  
- legacy building  

For many creators, the GitHubTree becomes:

- a **living archive**,  
- a **teaching tool**,  
- a **comprehensive personal library**,  
- and a **historical record of creativity.**

This aligns with:

- Web3 ethos  
- IFAM transparency  
- Random Rain documentation standards  
- Blockyright provenance tracking  
- Web3tionary entry lineage

## 6. Provenance (Domains, CIDs, Timestamps)

**Creator:** Lloyd W. Jones Jr. (BigInkLLC)

**Domains Owned:**  
*(Add optional DN if you choose to brand this term)*

**Repository Reference:**  
- `Web3tionary/Entries/GitHubTree.md`

**IPFS (Future):**  
- GitHubTree diagram  
- branching visualization  
- ecosystem history timeline  

---

## 7. Status & Governance
**Status:** Accepted — Founder Entry  

DAO Notes:  
Future refinements may introduce related terms like:

- RepoGraph  
- IdeaTree  
- CommitBranches  
- Ecosystem Map  

Edits must retain the focus on **provenance, lineage, and structure.**

---

## 8. Media (Optional)
Ideal visuals include:

- a branching tree showing repo ancestry  
- nodes representing repos  
- arrows showing concept evolution  
- ecosystem-level diagrams
