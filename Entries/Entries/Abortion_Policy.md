## 1. Plain Definition
A decentralized Abortion Policy is a blockchain-based agreement in which individuals or families pre-establish financial responsibilities, support commitments, or cost-sharing arrangements related to reproductive decisions — recorded in a transparent yet privacy-preserving manner.

In simple terms:  
**A digitally notarized responsibility agreement created voluntarily between consenting parties.**

---

## 2. Technical Definition
In a Web3 context, an Abortion Policy refers to a *smart contract framework* designed to:

- allocate financial responsibility  
- record voluntary commitments  
- timestamp agreements  
- designate beneficiaries  
- manage conditional fund releases  
- provide transparency for all parties involved  
- reduce public-system burden by resolving responsibilities privately  

Key features may include:

- **wallet-based commitments**  
- **escrow deposits**  
- **conditional payouts**  
- **privacy-enabled metadata**  
- **off-chain encrypted documentation**  
- **revocation conditions or amendments**  
- **multi-signature consent mechanisms**  

This concept is *not* a healthcare directive or political position.  
It is a structural model illustrating how blockchain tools might be used to establish voluntary, pre-agreed responsibilities between adults.

## 3. Parable / Use Case  
Two adults, aware of their differing long-term views on reproductive matters, agreed that:

If a pregnancy occurred,  
each would have predetermined roles —  
including financial support, medical expenses, or other responsibilities.

They used a **private smart contract** to record their voluntary agreement.  
Only they possessed the keys.  
Should circumstances arise, the blockchain would simply execute the commitments they chose in advance.

This arrangement was referred to as their **decentralized abortion policy**.

---

## 4. Example Sentences
- “They created a private abortion policy so their responsibilities were clear and pre-agreed.”  
- “A decentralized abortion policy can reduce conflict by defining expectations ahead of time.”  
- “The DAO requires that any discussion of abortion policies remain strictly neutral and structural.”

## 5. Cultural Notes
This term enters Web3tionary as a **mirror term** — documenting how decentralized technologies may be applied to real-life areas of responsibility, autonomy, and agreement.

Important contextual notes:

- The term does **not** define whether abortion is right or wrong.  
- It does **not** advocate any specific political, religious, or ethical stance.  
- It does **not** replace medical, legal, or psychological consultations.  
- It does **not** judge personal decisions.

Instead, it acknowledges:

- the social reality that reproductive decisions carry differing personal, moral, and financial implications  
- the potential for blockchain to record pre-agreed commitments  
- the desire of some individuals to settle responsibilities without involving the public system  
- the cultural conversations surrounding autonomy, responsibility, and transparency

**Status:** Protected Term — DAO-Restricted  
This means:

- edits require DAO review  
- contributors must follow sensitivity guidelines  
- framing must remain neutral and structural  
- no moral or political assertions may be added  
- changes require multisig approval once governance is active

## 8. Media (Optional)

Examples may include:

- responsibility-flow diagram  
- encrypted smart contract illustration  
- privacy layers graphic  

Literal or medical imagery is **not permitted** within this entry.
