## 1. Plain Definition
Afroingenuity refers to the long-standing tradition of creativity, innovation, problem-solving, and resourcefulness demonstrated across African and African American communities — both historically and in the present day.

In simple words:  
**Ingenuity shaped by culture, resilience, and lived experience.**
