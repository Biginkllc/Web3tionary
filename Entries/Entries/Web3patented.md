## 1. Plain Definition
**Web3patented** refers to an idea, creation, design, or concept that has been recorded on the blockchain — establishing a permanent timestamp and hash that serve as decentralized proof of origin.

In simple terms:  
**Web3patented = timestamped on-chain as prior art.**

This does *not* replace legal patents; it documents authorship, sequence, and originality in a way that cannot be altered.

---

## 2. Technical Definition
A Web3patented item is any intellectual or creative work that has been:

- stamped on a blockchain  
- hashed and stored on IPFS  
- published in a GitHub repo  
- indexed through decentralized domains  
- or documented in any immutable ledger  

such that:

- the origin date is undeniable  
- the ownership trail is transparent  
- any later claimant must overcome cryptographic proof  
- the work becomes public “prior art,” limiting infringement attempts  
- the author gains ethical and community protection  

Web3patented represents the **decentralized equivalent of filing prior art**, leveraging:

- blockchain immutability  
- GitHub commit timestamps  
- IPFS permanence  
- decentralized identity verification  
- smart contract attestations  

Together these form a **multi-layer provenance shield**.

## 3. Parable / Use Case
A designer created a new token standard but lacked funds for a formal patent.

Instead, she:

1. published the design to GitHub,  
2. pinned a PDF to IPFS, and  
3. linked both through her `.crypto` domain.  

Months later, a large company attempted to claim the idea.

But the chain told the truth:  
the work was **Web3patented** long before they touched it.

The community rallied around her, and the claim collapsed.

## 4. Example Sentences
- “Before sharing the prototype, Web3patent it so no one can steal the idea.”  
- “The DAO will only review submissions that are already Web3patented.”  
- “He didn’t hire lawyers — he just Web3patented the blueprint.”  
- “Your GitHub repo timestamps serve as Web3patented proof.”

## 5. Cultural Notes
Web3patented signals a major cultural shift:

- from centralized protection → decentralized proof  
- from expensive filings → accessible timestamps  
- from secrecy → transparent authorship  
- from power imbalance → community-backed integrity  

This term works hand-in-hand with **Blockyright**, but differs in important ways:

### Blockyright  
- ethical shield  
- community judgment  
- cultural protection  
- framing of “idea theft”  
- moral accountability  

### Web3patented  
- technical shield  
- cryptographic timestamp  
- archival verification  
- procedural accountability  
- legal-adjacent tool  

Together, they form a **decentralized intellectual property system** that is accessible to all.

**External Provenance Layers:**  
- GitHub commit timestamps

## 7. Status & Governance
**Status:** Accepted — Founder Entry  

DAO Notes:  
The term may require future clarification distinguishing:

- Web3patented (timestamped prior art)  
- Web3patent (formal decentralized patent structure)  
- Web3notary (attestation systems)  

Edits must preserve neutrality and avoid implying legal advice.

## 8. Media (Optional)
Recommended visuals include:

- a blockchain “stamp” graphic  
- decentralized proof-of-origin diagram  
- time → hash → CID → repo flowchart  
- contrasting Web2 patent vs Web3patented timeline
