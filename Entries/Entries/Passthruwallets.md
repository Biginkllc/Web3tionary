## 1. Plain Definition
Passthruwallets are Web3 domain–linked crypto wallets used primarily as **routing points** rather than storage — allowing funds to be sent to a domain and then immediately forwarded to another address.

In simple terms:  
**A passthruwallet is a “pass-through” address that receives crypto and then moves it onward.**

---

## 2. Technical Definition
In a Web3 context, Passthruwallets refer to wallets mapped to decentralized domains (such as UD domains) that:

- receive crypto on behalf of a user  
- are NOT intended for long-term holding  
- serve as convenient, human-readable receiving points  
- forward or re-route funds to a designated final wallet  
- reduce exposure of private or primary wallet addresses  

Key characteristics:

- domain-based human-readable address (ex: **yourname.crypto**)  
- temporary storage  
- immediate or manual forwarding  
- privacy-preserving separation between public & private wallets  
- no exchange features (these are NOT trading wallets)  
- often used for donations, testing, onboarding, or low-touch transactions  

Passthruwallets are especially common among:

- UD users  
- creators  
- donors  
- educators  
- airdrop participants  
- first-time crypto users  
- DAOs that separate public receiving wallets from treasury storage  

They are the **digital cousin of a P.O. Box** —  
safe to share publicly because the real destination is hidden behind it.

## 3. Parable / Use Case
He didn’t want to post his primary wallet publicly.  
Instead, he connected his UD domain to a passthruwallet.

Whenever someone sent crypto to **hisname.crypto**,  
the funds immediately moved to his secure cold wallet.

To the outside world, the passthruwallet was the “front door,”  
but the living room remained private.

---

## 4. Example Sentences
- “Send the donation to my passthruwallet — the funds will route safely.”  
- “I use passthruwallets for airdrops so my main wallet stays clean.”  
- “Creators often publish passthruwallets instead of exposing their real address.”  
- “Every UD domain is essentially a passthruwallet unless the user holds assets there.”

---

## 5. Cultural Notes
Passthruwallets reflect a central Web3 principle:

**Privacy isn’t secrecy — it’s protection.**

People use passthruwallets to:

- avoid doxxing their primary wallet  
- simplify sharing of payment information  
- maintain public transparency while retaining private security  
- reduce risk from copying/pasting complex hex addresses  
- protect themselves from tracking  
- ensure funds are routed to secure storage  

As adoption grows, passthruwallets may become standard practice for:

- influencers  
- businesses  
- charities  
- DAOs  
- community organizers  
- content creators  
- Web3 marketplaces  

This term helps formalize a behavior many already use —  
but until now, no one had a word for it.

DAO Notes:  
Future contributors may add related sub-terms such as:
