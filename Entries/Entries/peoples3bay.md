# peoples3bay — Founder Entry  
*(Alternates: Peoples3Bay, People’s 3Bay)*

---

## Plain Definition  
**peoples3bay** is a peer-to-peer, dignity-preserving marketplace where individuals can sell items or accept voluntary crypto “support contributions” through passthruwallets. It blends traditional local selling with Web3 empowerment, allowing people to earn directly — with no gatekeepers, no platform fees, and no barriers to participation.

In simple terms:  
**peoples3bay = the people’s marketplace + optional humanitarian support.**

---

## Technical Definition  
peoples3bay is a **Web3-enabled P2P marketplace protocol** built around four core features:

### 1. Direct Crypto Payments  
- Every listing connects to a **passthruwallet**.  
- Buyers send payment directly to the seller’s wallet.  
- No custody, no intermediaries, no delays.  
- Payments may be classified as *purchases*, *support*, or *gifts* by the parties involved.

### 2. Dual-Mode Pricing (Sell or Support)  
Every listing may include:

- a **sale price**,  
- a **“support” (donation/tip) option**,  
- or both.

This allows users to:

- sell an item at market value, or  
- accept contributions that help them move the item, avoid storage costs, or simply provide assistance.

### 3. Domain-Native Identity  
Listings can reference Web3 domains (.crypto, .dao, .bitcoin, .nft) as identity markers.  
This adds transparency and builds trust through:

- verifiable wallet ownership  
- timestamped profiles  
- GitHub provenance  
- IPFS-linked media  

### 4. Community-Centered, Not Corporate  
peoples3bay rejects the marketplace model where:

- platforms extract fees,  
- visibility is pay-to-play,  
- and success depends on algorithms.

Instead, it relies on:

- peer-discovery  
- decentralization  
- passthruwallet liquidity  
- dignity-first exchange  
- optional DAO governance in the future  

This supports people who are selling under financial pressure, decluttering urgently, or downsizing.

## Parable / Use Case  
A man has a radial arm saw sitting in a storage unit costing him $145 each month.  
He listed it on a traditional marketplace for $89 with *local pickup only* —  
but after three months, not a single bite.

On **peoples3bay**, he could:

- list it for $50,  
- accept support contributions from those who simply want to help,  
- or receive a mix of sale + support.

Someone might send $20 saying,  
> “I hope this helps you clear that storage space.”

Another might message,  
> “I’ll buy it and pick it up.”

The result?  
He moves forward, not backward.  
The community participates with dignity.  
And the entire transaction is peer-to-peer, transparent, and instant.

## Cultural Notes  
peoples3bay exists at the intersection of:

- **Selfmonetize** — empowering people to earn directly  
- **Passthruwallets** — frictionless payment channels  
- **Stimulusdrops** — purposeful compassion  
- **Random Rain** — unexpected provision  
- **SpeakDomainish** — identity through domains  
- **Walletmanagers** — assistance for vulnerable users  

It acknowledges a simple truth:

> Not everything is a “sale.”  
> Sometimes people just need *support* — without shame.

peoples3bay creates a space where:

- selling is respected,  
- giving is welcomed,  
- dignity is preserved,  
- and community replaces corporate profit motives.

- `peoples3bay.crypto`

## Blockchain Timestamp Uses  
- timestamped listings  
- provenance for item photos  
- donation/support receipts

A **peoples3bayDAO** may govern:

- marketplace guidelines  
- visibility algorithms (if any)  
- conflict resolution  
- category creation  
- community standards  
- fraud monitoring (via transparent logs)  

Governance must maintain:

- transparency  
- autonomy  
- dignity
