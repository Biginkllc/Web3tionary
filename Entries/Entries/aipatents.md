# aipatents — Founder Entry  
*(Alternates: AI-Patents, AIPatented)*

---

## Plain Definition  
**aipatents** refers to inventions, innovations, or creative works that are:

- generated by artificial intelligence,  
- recorded on a blockchain,  
- and protected through decentralized timestamping rather than traditional patent offices.

In simple language:  
**aipatents = patents for an AI world, secured by the chain rather than institutions.**

---

## Technical Definition  
AI-generated intellectual property presents unique challenges:

- Who is the inventor?  
- Who owns the rights?  
- How is originality proven?  
- How is priority established?  

**aipatents** solves this through:

- **hash-based authorship tracking**  
- **blockchain timestamps** establishing novelty  
- **decentralized claims of origin**  
- **transparent public audit trails**

It complements, or in some cases bypasses, traditional patent bureaucracies.

## Parable / Use Case  
An AI produces a novel blueprint for a water filtration system.  
Before anyone else can copy or claim it, the creator:

- hashes the blueprint  
- stores the metadata on-chain  
- anchors the file via IPFS  
- proves timestamped origin  

They have effectively **patented** the invention through decentralized verification — an **AI patent**, or *aipatent*.
