*(Alternates: EtchedInStone, Etched-in-Stone)*

## Plain Definition  
**etchedinstone** describes any information placed on a blockchain in a way that makes it **permanent, immutable, and resistant to alteration**, much like ancient inscriptions carved into stone.

To “etch something in stone” on-chain is to make it verifiable forever.

---

## Technical Definition  
In blockchain terminology, **etchedinstone** refers to data that:

- has been hashed,  
- recorded in a block,  
- propagated across nodes,  
- timestamped,  
- validated by consensus,  
- and rendered effectively unchangeable.

Once recorded, it becomes:

- **tamper-proof**  
- **censorship-resistant**  
- **globally readable**  
- **auditable indefinitely**

This term captures the essence of Web3 immutability in a metaphor universally understood.

## Parable / Use Case  
Before digital archives existed, a ruler might have engraved laws into a stone tablet so the public could see them and know they couldn’t be changed secretly.

In Web3, when someone records:

- an agreement,  
- an invention,  
- a signature,  
- a declaration,  
- or a proof of origin  

onto a blockchain, they are **etching it in digital stone** — a public monument of truth.

## Cultural Notes  
This term pairs naturally with:

- **blockyright**  
- **ideavault**  
- **timestamp governance**  
- **truth verification**

etchedinstone becomes a cultural symbol within Web3tionary for:

- permanence  
- legacy  
- transparency  
- protection against historical revision
