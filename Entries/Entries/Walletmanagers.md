## 1. Plain Definition
**Walletmanagers** are trusted individuals, organizations, ministries, or community-appointed stewards who manage crypto wallets for people who are unable, unwilling, or not yet equipped to manage them themselves — especially the poor, homeless, elderly, digitally inexperienced, or temporarily incapacitated.

Put simply:  
**Walletmanagers help the vulnerable participate in Web3 safely.**

---

## 2. Technical / Contextual Definition
A Walletmanager is responsible for:

- setting up a crypto wallet for a beneficiary  
- securing private keys  
- managing incoming donations  
- logging distributions transparently  
- preventing exploitation  
- ensuring donated funds are used ethically  
- helping recipients transition into self-management (when possible)  

Walletmanagers operate using:

- **passthruwallets** for public-facing donation addresses  
- **subwallets** for recipients  
- **multi-sig controls** (optional)  
- **receipt logs** (on-chain or GitHub-based)  
- **QR-coded cups, badges, or signage**  
- **domain-linked wallet identities** (e.g., `.crypto`)  

The role blends:

- ministry  
- stewardship  
- financial literacy  
- harm reduction  
- accountability  
- compassion  
- technology assistance  

It is *not* a custodial service for profit.  
It is a **humanitarian service for dignity.**

## 3. Parable / Use Case
A homeless man stood at a traffic light holding a cardboard sign:

> “Homeless. Anything helps. God bless.”

He had no bank account, no ID, no phone plan.  
Cash was unpredictable, dangerous, and often stolen.

A volunteer gave him a cup with a QR code linked to a passthruwallet.  
The funds went directly to **Walletmanagers** at Beta Street Church,  
who logged every donation and distributed help responsibly:

- meals  
- toiletries  
- transit fare  
- shelter fees  
- emergency needs  

He never touched a seed phrase,  
never risked theft,  
never had to navigate exchanges.

For him, Web3 wasn’t technology.  
It was **dignity restored.**

## 4. Example Sentences
- “Our ministry partners act as Walletmanagers for the digitally vulnerable.”  
- “She can’t manage a crypto wallet yet, so a Walletmanager handles her incoming donations.”  
- “Walletmanagers protect the homeless from scams and theft.”  
- “A Walletmanager ensures Stimulusdrops reach the intended recipient.”  
- “Passthruwallets + Walletmanagers = compassionate crypto infrastructure.”

---

## 5. Cultural Notes
Walletmanagers answer a fundamental question:

> **“How do we include people who cannot self-custody?”**

This is vital because Web3 often excludes:

- the homeless  
- elderly  
- those without tech literacy  
- people in crisis  
- displaced individuals  
- those with cognitive limitations  

Walletmanagers create:

- equitable access  
- safe donation channels  
- trust bridges  
- ministry pathways  
- educational stepping stones  
- ethical stewardship frameworks  

It is one of the earliest **Web3 humanitarian job roles**,  
blending ancient compassion with modern tools.

Your early photos (2023) document:

- QR-code cups for street donations  
- church signage  
- concept art of processing centers  
- field testing with paid actors  
- shower and hygiene service prototypes  

These are historical artifacts of the idea’s formation.
