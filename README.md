# Web3tionary# Web3tionary — A Community-Driven Dictionary for Web3

**Web3tionary** is an open-source project building the first decentralized dictionary of Web3 terms, slang, and innovations.  
Every entry is written, visualized, and timestamped by the community, stored on IPFS, and governed by **Web3tionaryDAO**.

---

## ✍️ How it Works
- **Contributors** submit new terms, phrases, or coined words.  
- Each entry includes:  
  - **Plain Definition** (everyday language)  
  - **Technical Definition** (precise, blockchain/web3 context)  
  - **Parable / Use Case** (relatable story or metaphor)  
  - **Media Tie-in** (NFT image card, oversized dictionary page, or IPFS scroll)  
- Entries are timestamped on-chain and owned via IPFS CIDs and Web3 domains.  

---

## 🌍 Governance
- DAO format (**Web3tionaryDAO**) with tokenized voting for term acceptance.  
- Reputation & credits for contributors whose entries are adopted.  
- NFT mints of select entries fund hosting and DAO treasury.  

---

## 🛠️ Infrastructure
- IPFS for permanent storage of entries & visuals.  
- Smart contracts lock timestamp & ownership.  
- Domains like `web3tionary.crypto` or `web3tionary.blockchain` redirect to the living dictionary.

## 📜 DAO Charter (Outline Draft)
- **Membership:** Anyone holding `W3T` (Web3tionary Token) can vote.  
- **Proposal Flow:**  
  1. Contributor submits entry (pull request + CID).  
  2. DAO members vote to accept/reject.  
  3. Accepted entries are minted as NFTs (treasury earns %).  
- **Voting Weights:**  
  - 1 token = 1 vote.  
  - Reputation credits (non-transferable) can boost voting power.  
- **Treasury Use:**  
  - Cover IPFS pinning fees.  
  - Fund artists/writers for curated entries.  
  - Bounties for underrepresented categories.
