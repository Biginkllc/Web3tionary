# Web3tionary — A Living Dictionary of Web3 Words, Meanings & Movements

**Web3tionary** is an open-source, community-built dictionary documenting the evolving language of Web3 — slang, coined terms, cultural phenomena, protocols, and future-shaping concepts. Entries are proposed, refined, and timestamped by the public, with final governance handled through **Web3tionaryDAO**.

## ✍️ How It Works

- 🔤 **Submit a Term**  
  Anyone can propose a new term via pull request using the entry template.

- 🧠 **Multi-Dimensional Definitions**  
  Each entry contains:
  - **Plain Definition** (in everyday language)  
  - **Technical Definition** (in Web3 context)  
  - **Parable or Use Case** (short story, scenario, or metaphor)  
  - **Media Tie-In** (oversized dictionary image, NFT card, IPFS scroll, etc.)  
  - **Timestamp + Provenance** (IPFS CID, on-chain proof, GitHub commit)

- 🧱 **Governance by DAO**  
  Entries are voted in or revised by `W3T` token holders. Select entries may be minted as NFTs or featured in decentralized glossaries.

## 🔐 Founder’s Notes

**Some entries — such as _Blockyright_ and _Traorelization_ — are reserved by the Web3tionary founder for early inclusion.** These terms represent foundational linguistic architecture for DAO vocabulary, protocol ethics, and provenance mechanisms.

Proposed entries may be reviewed in stages (Prototype → Draft → Final). Community feedback and refinement are encouraged.
