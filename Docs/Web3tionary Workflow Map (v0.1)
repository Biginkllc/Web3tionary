This document explains the complete lifecycle of a Web3tionary entry — from idea to archival storage.

It ensures consistency across GitHub, IPFS, Reddit, and DAO governance.

# 2. Detailed Stage Breakdown

## Stage 1 — Idea Formation
A contributor, founder, or community member invents or proposes a new Web3 term, phrase, or concept.

Inputs may include:
- real-world events  
- cultural trends  
- new domain purchases  
- innovations  
- metaphors  
- critiques  
- questions  

---

## Stage 2 — Template Completion
Contributor downloads or copies:

`Docs/ENTRY_TEMPLATE.md`

They fill in:
- Root Term  
- Raw Form  
- Expanded Form  
- Definitions  
- Parable / Use Case  
- Provenance  
- Creator  
- Media (optional)  

When ready, they proceed to submission.

---

## Stage 3 — GitHub Submission (Pull Request)
Contributor creates a new markdown file:


and submits a Pull Request (PR).

PR must include:
- Full entry template  
- Clear commit message  
- Any media links (CID, images, diagrams)  
- Attribution  

PR is now visible to all.

---

## Stage 4 — Optional Public Discussion
Before DAO vote, the term may be discussed on:
- Reddit  
- GitHub Discussions  
- Social media threads  

Purpose:
- refine meaning  
- test cultural resonance  
- gather parables  
- observe community interpretations  

These discussions may be summarized in the entry’s **DAO Notes**.

---

## Stage 5 — DAO Review
DAO members (or founder during early stage):

- verify clarity  
- request edits  
- check provenance  
- check raw form accuracy  
- evaluate cultural impact  
- ensure the term belongs in the dictionary  

If ready, they move to voting.

---

## Stage 6 — DAO Vote
Outcomes:
- **Accept**  
- **Request Revision**  
- **Reject**  

Accepted terms go to the merge phase.  
Drafts remain open until improved.

Founder Entries may bypass voting if necessary.

---

## Stage 7 — Merge & Acceptance
Once approved:
- Entry is merged into `/Entries/`  
- Marked “Accepted (Active)”  
- Added to `Docs/Seed_Entries.md` (dictionary index)  

This makes the term an official part of the Web3tionary.

---

## Stage 8 — IPFS Archival
The entry and any visuals (dictionary page images, diagrams, NFT versions) are pinned to IPFS.

Storage options:
- individual CIDs  
- multi-file bundles  
- quarterly or annual dictionaries (“Volumes”)  

The IPFS CID is added to the entry’s **Provenance** section.

---

## Stage 9 — Announcement & Visibility
Approved terms may be:
- featured in a Reddit announcement post  
- shared on social channels  
- minted as limited NFT cards  
- added to a “recent additions” section  

This helps the community track linguistic evolution.
