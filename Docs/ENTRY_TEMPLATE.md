## 2. Definitions

**Plain Definition (Everyday Language):**  
Explain it like you’re talking to a curious friend who knows nothing about Web3.

> Example:  
> “Blockyright is a way of proving you came up with an idea first by timestamping it on public systems instead of filing legal paperwork.”

**Technical Definition (Web3 / Protocol Context):**  
Precise, slightly more formal. Include references to blockchain, IPFS, domains, etc., if relevant.

> Example:  
> “Blockyright is a provenance mechanism that uses Git commit history, IPFS CIDs, and/or on-chain timestamps to establish publicly verifiable origin for creative or conceptual work.”

**Example Sentences (2–4):**  
Show how people might naturally use this term in conversation.

> “We should blockyright it before we share the deck.”
